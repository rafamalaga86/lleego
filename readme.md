## My Test for Lleego

I lasted about 7 hours. I would have lasted less if not because I never used Symfony ever before, and needed a couple of hours extra to familiarize myself with the framework.

For better clarity I divided the ports in Outbound Ports and Inbound Ports, depending if they manage input or output.

The format of the time in "start" is in 12 hours clock to make it coincide with the PDF Prueba t√©cnica. But obviously that is dangerous, and I would format it in 24hours clock instead.

I did write everything in English. If you rather have it in spanish just let me know.

I normally would not commit in git the .env file. But for making it easier to check the exercise, I did now.

There was some parts I did not implement because I thought was not the purpose of the exercise, like data validation. But if you want me to implement it, just let me know.

The controller and the command are obviously adapters, but I rather leave them in their own directory for better organisation in the long run.
